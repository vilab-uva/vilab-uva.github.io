<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>ImagiQ (pronounced ‚Äúimage-IQ‚Äù) is a research project funded by the National Science Foundation‚Äôs <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/">Convergence Accelerator Program</a> (Track D-0532; OIA #2040532 - PI Stephen Baek). The project aim to solve one of the most critical challenges in adapting AI technologies in medical imaging‚Äîthe issue of patient data sharing: Many of the modern AI models are extremely data-hungry and require a large cohort of patient data for training and validation. However, creating a large dataset can be tremendously expensive, as it requires a lot of manual labor, tedious data annotation tasks, expensive physician time, and such. Collecting datasets across multiple hospitals collaboratively may mitigate this issue, but this imposes a great deal of practical impediments including HIPAA regulation, IRB protocols, etc.</p>

<p>To this end, ImagiQ aims to develop a use-inspired technology for federated learning. The project entails collaboration among 5 academic institutions across the United States, including the University of Iowa, Stanford, University of Chicago, Harvard, and Yale, as well as industry partners such as NVIDIA, Lunit, Digital Diagnostics, and a few others. This project will result in a new, use-inspired platform for collaborative AI model development that removes the hurdles of sharing sensitive medical imaging data. The new platform will accelerate the translation of AI models into clinics, while still more rigorously validating them on large, heterogeneous patient data. <strong>For patients and doctors</strong>, this innovative technology will help to improve the quality of healthcare by augmenting the cognitive capacity of clinicians with more accurate, trustworthy, and safe AI. <strong>For medical researchers</strong>, the new platform will considerably accelerate scientific discovery by removing the hurdles of extramural model training and validation. <strong>For industry</strong>, the newly developed open-source ImagiQ platform will serve as a convenient framework for developing FL solutions. <strong>Externally to medical imaging</strong>, the proposed concept is easily extensible to broader areas, where sharing sensitive data is the major bottleneck, such as connected vehicles, national security/defense, consumer electronics, etc., and will benefit the society with safer and more reliable AI.</p>
